For begining of year call a choice method that will ask you everything you want to do so you can do multiple things a year
give option to quit job and have new choices
add chance to fail job interview and not get a job (the more money you make the harder the job)
impliment random chances for different ages outline. so no random event yet, just where it calls based on age
put age in person class so you can add more than one year at a time.
